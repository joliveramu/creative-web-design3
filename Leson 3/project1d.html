    <p>In information technology, the hardware is the physical aspect of computers, telecommunications, and other devices. 
        The term arose as a way to distinguish the "box" and the electronic circuitry and components of a computer from the program you put in it to make it do things.

    <p>
        When using computer hardware, an upgrade means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance, adds capacity, or new features. 
        For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the hard drive with an SSD to get a boost in performance or increase the number of files that may be stored. 
        Also, the user could increase the RAM so the computer may run more smoothly.
