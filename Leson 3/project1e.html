        A desktop computer (or desktop PC) is a computer that is designed to stay in a single location. 
        It may be a tower (also known as a system unit) or an all-in-one machine, such as an iMac. 
        Unlike laptops and other portable devices, desktop computers cannot be powered from an internal battery and therefore must remain connected to a wall outlet.

        While desktop computers were the most popular type of personal computer for several decades, in recent years, laptop sales have surpassed those of desktop PCs. 
        Because of the rise in mobile computing, this trend is likely to continue. However, desktop computers remain the most popular choice for business workstations and family computers.
